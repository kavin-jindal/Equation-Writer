# Equation-Writer (Beta)
This is an Equation Writer coded in Python. You can use mathematical symbols easily and also save your files in text files and also copy paste it to other places.

# Important Note:

--> I am currently working on making this program compatible with Python 2. Because there are various complications to run this program with Python 3. The next update of Equation Writer might include a Python Version 2 Compatibiltiy. 

# General Info
--> This program has been made to make it easier to write mathematical symbols without using any external website or editor or using character maps.

--> This is still under development and I have released its Beta version only. The future updates will include many new features.

--> You just need to press a button of your choice to insert the equation.

**Update 1.2**

*A new update after a long time!!*

This update includes the following:

* Removed Spacebar
* Added alpha, beta, and gamma symbols
* Added a format tab
* Added bold and italics text formatting

You can not save your file containing symbols due to encoding errors, you can copy it to a text file normally. I am working upon this bug to fix it
